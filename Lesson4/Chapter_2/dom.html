    <!--When using JavaScript to access certain HTML elements there might be some unexpected results due to the time the HTML page takes to load
        which leads to the JavaScript accessing the element before it has loaded, a solution would be to put the script tag in the end of the body
        tag, a practice reccommended by many developers-->
